# Online Store Website

## About

This is an imaginary online store website that isn't really that fleshed out.
Just a few components here and there but I was experimenting with bootstrap and
svelte and so I got a bit carried away with things.

## Assets

The assets (images) are just sourced from Nike, but by no means is this
affiliated or corresponding with Nike, nor are any of these items being
advertised or sold by me. I repeat, **you can't actually buy anything.**.

## Preview


## Developing

If you want to play around with the website you can start up a development environment.

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the website:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
